Competitive Intelligence Report: The MENA Food and Quick Commerce Delivery Market
Executive Summary: Strategic Landscape and Implications for Talabat
The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) delivery ecosystem is entering a crucial new phase defined by escalating competition on two primary fronts: capital-intensive market disruption and advanced monetization strategies. While the market continues its aggressive expansion—the Q-Commerce segment alone is projected to grow at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 20.77% through 2032 1—Talabat’s leadership position is increasingly challenged by sophisticated competitors.
The market landscape is characterized by a fundamental dichotomy. On one side, Talabat has successfully established a structural revenue defense via its subscription model, Talabat Pro, creating a robust retention moat.2 On the other, challenger Keeta (backed by Meituan) has unleashed a massive, subsidy-fueled market blitzkrieg aimed at rapid Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) capture, achieving an impressive 8% GMV share in Saudi Arabia (KSA) in just two quarters.3 Simultaneously, KSA-based Jahez is setting the standard for financial resilience by pioneering advanced in-app retail media monetization, achieving a 60.8% Year-over-Year (YoY) surge in advertising revenue in H1 2025.4
This analysis confirms that continued victory requires more than just high brand visibility; it demands financial ingenuity and a culturally resonant narrative.
Key Findings Synthesis
The competitive battlespace has transitioned from platform scale to unit economic sustainability and user lock-in. Talabat’s strong H1 2025 performance, featuring a 35% YoY revenue increase 5, provides the necessary financial latitude to engage. However, the success of Jahez's retail media platform (RMP) model represents a critical emerging threat to Talabat’s long-term revenue diversification and merchant partnership depth. Keeta’s ability to quickly secure market share through aggressive capital burn necessitates a counter-strategy that is robust but non-price-based.
Top 3 Strategic Recommendations
Weaponize Authenticity Against Price: Talabat should immediately deploy its new "realness and authenticity" positioning to explicitly contrast Keeta’s purely transactional, heavy subsidy play. The goal is to reposition Talabat as the culturally embedded, trustworthy, everyday partner, fundamentally distinct from a temporary, capital-subsidized discount engine.
Accelerate Retail Media Penetration: To diversify revenue and fund competitive marketing, Talabat must prioritize and accelerate the replication and refinement of advanced merchant ad products, mirroring or surpassing Jahez’s success with short-form video formats like "Fawase!".4 Deepening merchant relationships via monetization secures Talabat’s position as a necessary marketing channel, not just a delivery utility.
Solidify the Subscription Moat in Growth Markets: Aggressively market and expand the Talabat Pro subscription model, emphasizing themes like those used in the #GetTarektogopro campaign 6, particularly in high-growth, non-GCC markets (Egypt, Jordan). Converting users to high-Lifetime Value (LTV) subscribers creates immediate financial lock-in before challengers can afford to build similar retention structures.
Part I: Market Context and Financial Health of the MENA Delivery Ecosystem
1.1 Regional Market Size and Growth Trajectories
The MENA delivery market demonstrates significant vitality, driven by urbanization, high digital adoption, and supportive national development agendas. The overall regional Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) stood at approximately $6.1 billion in 2023.7
The most dynamic growth is occurring within Quick Commerce (Q-Commerce), the segment encompassing ultra-fast delivery (under 60 minutes) for groceries and essentials. This market niche is currently valued at $565.85 million (2023) and is projected to surge to $2.917 billion by 2032, expanding at a vigorous CAGR of 20.77%.1 This exponential growth confirms that competition is shifting beyond prepared meals and into the broader realm of convenience retail, necessitating substantial investment in logistics, particularly hyperlocal dark stores and micro-fulfillment centers, to meet the sub-60-minute delivery promise.1
Geographically, Saudi Arabia stands as the largest market, fueled by high urban density, significant disposable income, and government initiatives like Vision 2030, which explicitly support smart logistics and digital integration.1 The UAE follows closely, capitalizing on innovation in urban planning. The strong CAGR for the Q-Commerce sector suggests that the regulatory landscape in the region has been highly supportive, enabling rapid technology adoption and minimizing logistical friction, a factor which Keeta strategically leveraged through its recent Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the UAE Ministry of Investment.2 Food and beverages remain the dominant product category, reinforcing the central role of existing food aggregators in capturing this expanding market.1
1.2 Talabat's H1 2025 Performance Review and Strategic Anchors
Talabat entered the second half of 2025 from a position of financial strength, providing a crucial advantage in the escalating competitive battles. The company reported a GMV of $2.4 billion for the first half of 2025, marking a substantial 32% Year-over-Year (YoY) increase. Revenue growth was even stronger, rising 35% YoY to reach $982 million.5 This divergence—revenue growth outpacing GMV growth—indicates successful monetization efforts, such as higher take rates, effective advertisement sales, or strong subscription conversion, suggesting superior unit economics compared to competitors relying purely on subsidized growth.
A review of market composition indicates a successful push into newer territories. While GCC markets remain the core engine of growth, contributing 83% of the total GMV, this figure represents a decrease from 86% in the previous year.5 This signifies increased customer acquisition and frequency in non-GCC markets, validating the strategic use of investment and promotional activity in territories like Egypt and Jordan.
The subscription model, Talabat Pro, serves as the central pillar of Talabat’s retention strategy. For approximately AED 19 per month, Pro users receive critical benefits such as free delivery and exclusive discounts.2 This subscription offering creates a high switching cost, or "retention moat," for frequent users, positioning it as the primary defense against purely price-based competition. This lock-in strategy was a major focus of recent media efforts, exemplified by the Summer 2025 campaign which promoted the benefits of the subscription through the #GetTarektogopro narrative, tying marketing expenditure directly to high-LTV customer retention.6 Furthermore, Talabat benefits significantly from the mobile-first nature of the MENA market, processing an estimated 75% of all mobile food orders, amplifying the value of its entrenched app ecosystem and streamlined user experience.5
Part II: Competitor Profile and Strategy Analysis
2.1 Keeta (Meituan): The Capital-Backed Disruptor (UAE, KSA, Qatar)
Keeta, the international arm of the Chinese technology giant Meituan, represents the most immediate and disruptive threat to incumbents. Its strategy is predicated on aggressive capital injection to secure rapid scale.
2.1.1 Brand Positioning and Messaging: The Reliability Promise
Keeta's positioning is rooted in functional excellence: reliability and speed, backed by a clear "on-time promise".2 While it offers heavy discounts, the messaging aims to differentiate the brand on quality of service rather than merely being the cheapest option. In contrast to Talabat’s quest for cultural resonance and lifestyle integration (Talabat Pro), Keeta’s brand communication is highly transactional and volume-focused.
2.1.2 Marketing & Media Strategy: Aggressive Subsidy Blitz (H2 2024–H1 2025)
Keeta’s media strategy is defined by an entry blitz characterized by heavy subsidies, including introductory offers such as 50% off first meals and free delivery, designed to generate massive media momentum.2 This strategy proved extremely effective in KSA, where Keeta captured an impressive 8% GMV share in just two quarters, establishing itself as the fastest-growing player in the market.3 The impact was evident in user numbers, with active users in the Middle East spiking from 26K to nearly 875K during Q4 2024.9 Operationally, Keeta demonstrated strategic market timing, launching quickly across the Gulf: Qatar in August 2025, Kuwait in September 2025, and entering the UAE by late September 2025, signaling a deep strategic commitment backed by Meituan's resources.2 Critically, the company has sought local institutional alignment, evidenced by an MoU with the UAE Ministry of Investment and a commitment to creating approximately 350 jobs, a tactic designed to mitigate the perception of being a purely foreign entrant.2
2.1.3 Perceived Brand Health & Economics: Valuations and Growth Trajectory
Keeta's core competitive advantage lies in leveraging Meituan's proprietary operational playbooks, which include sophisticated techniques for routing, batching, dispatch optimization, and potentially even autonomous logistics.2 This provides significant operational advantages over local competitors. However, the current strategy is purely focused on GMV capture through short-term loss acceptance, making its financial health dependent on sustained capital funding rather than immediate unit profitability.
2.2 Jahez: The KSA Profitability Model (KSA Primary)
Jahez is the established local champion in KSA and represents the primary threat in terms of sophisticated financial modeling and revenue diversification.
2.2.1 Brand Positioning and Messaging: The Local Champion (KSA)
Jahez is positioned as the deep-rooted local platform that initially established the online food delivery model in KSA.3 The messaging emphasizes local relevance, strong merchant partnerships, and operational efficiency within the Kingdom.
2.2.2 Marketing & Media Strategy: Focus on In-App Retail Media (H1 2025)
The most significant development from Jahez is its successful transition into a Retail Media Platform (RMP). In H1 2025, Jahez reported a monumental 60.8% YoY surge in advertising revenue.4 This growth was driven by innovative, in-app advertising products, notably "Explore" and "Fawase!"—the latter being a short-form video reel format.4 This functionality effectively "TikTok-izes" food discovery, encouraging merchants to pay for prime visibility and engagement. This shift demonstrates that Jahez successfully convinced restaurants to use their platform not just for transactions, but as a critical marketing channel. While the company employed tactical promotions and delivery campaigns in KSA—which resulted in a 1.4 percentage point decline in gross profit margin in Q2 2025 10—the advertising revenue surge provided a crucial financial offset.
2.2.3 Perceived Brand Health & Economics: Profitability Drivers and Non-KSA Expansion
Jahez’s economic health is sound, supported by an improved take rate of 15.7% in Q2 2025.4 Furthermore, disciplined cost optimization efforts, including fleet optimization, resulted in a 5.7% YoY decrease in delivery cost per order.4 The strategy appears to be achieving unit economic discipline even in expansion markets, as the Non-KSA Platforms segment significantly narrowed its losses by 84.7% YoY.10 This sophisticated approach to monetization, using merchant ad spend to subsidize customer acquisition and operational improvements, positions Jahez as the most financially mature competitor, presenting a strategic blueprint that Talabat must emulate urgently.
2.3 Noon Food: The Ecosystem Integrator (UAE, KSA)
Noon Food leverages the strength and scale of its parent Noon.com e-commerce ecosystem.
Brand Positioning: Noon Food is positioned primarily on value and ecosystem convenience. By integrating delivery into its existing e-commerce and grocery stack, it provides a seamless experience for existing Noon users.2
Strategy: The platform relies on cross-subsidization of logistics and marketing, using shared infrastructure across all Noon verticals. Marketing often integrates with major e-commerce mega-sale events (like Noon 11), driving cross-platform traffic and order volume.2
Economics: Noon Food's profitability is viewed through the lens of overall user LTV across the entire Noon ecosystem, allowing them flexibility in pricing and promotions that pure-play aggregators cannot match. The primary challenge is maintaining the specialized speed and service quality of dedicated food delivery players while relying on shared logistics resources.
2.4 Careem NOW: The Super-App Bundler (UAE, Qatar)
Careem (now owned by Uber) employs the "super-app" strategy across the region.
Brand Positioning: Careem’s promise centers on multi-service utility, reliability, and trust, offering service guarantees (such as credits for late delivery).2
Strategy: The Careem Plus subscription model is its major retention tool, bundling perks across food, rides, and groceries to enhance cross-vertical stickiness, making the user decision to switch platforms highly inconvenient.2 Acquisition is heavily supported by strategic tie-ins and promotions with major banks and telecom operators.2
Economics: Careem's strategic value lies in the difficulty for users to unwind their reliance on the entire ecosystem. However, balancing the demands of ride-hailing and food delivery logistics during peak periods remains an operational challenge that can sometimes impact service consistency.
2.5 Deliveroo (UAE, Qatar – Premium Niche)
Deliveroo maintains a deliberate focus on the affluent, quality-sensitive market segment.
Brand Positioning: Internationally known for a premium experience, Deliveroo centers its messaging on curated restaurant selection, operational excellence, and high service quality.
Strategy: Marketing spend is targeted, focusing on exclusive partnerships and quality assurance messaging rather than mass-market OOH (Out-of-Home) campaigns or large-scale subsidies.
Economics: The business model relies on achieving high Average Order Value (AOV) via premium restaurant selection and service, operating on higher commission rates but lower overall volume compared to mass-market aggregators.
2.6 Iraq Market Specialists: talabatey & Toters (Iraq)
The delivery market in Iraq exemplifies the challenges and vulnerabilities in emerging growth markets.
2.6.1 talabatey: The Established Network
talabatey is positioned on its extensive network and established local presence, boasting listings from over 1000 restaurants in Iraq and Sudan.11 Its strategy relies on leveraging this network depth, making it a crucial platform for restaurant visibility in a fragmented logistical environment.
2.6.2 Toters: Digital Reach and User Engagement
Toters competes on user experience, specifically noted for the seamless, automatic application of loyalty rewards at checkout.12 While its active user base remains relatively small (around 87K in Q4 2024) 9, this focus on frictionless loyalty programs provides a key differentiator in terms of user experience (UX) quality. However, Toters faces potential reputational and operational fragility due to contract structures that reportedly limit the company's legal role to merely connecting drivers to the database, potentially shifting liability away from the company regarding worker rights.13 This ethical vulnerability presents a significant point of contrast for competitors like Talabat, who actively promote CSR initiatives.
Part III: Strategic Comparative Analysis & Market Dynamics
3.1 Competitive Intensity Mapping: Mature vs. Growth Markets
The intensity of competition varies significantly across the MENA landscape, driven by market maturity and capital availability.
Mature Markets (UAE, Kuwait, Qatar): These markets exhibit saturation, demanding highly sophisticated strategies. Competition is defined by subscription wars (Talabat Pro vs. Careem Plus) and the intrusion of deep-pocketed disruptors like Keeta. Strategic success relies heavily on retention and sophisticated merchant monetization, as demonstrated by the continued robust growth in digital storefronts (e.g., Talabat UAE growing 5.7% from Q4 2023 to Q1 2024).14 The battle here is for wallet share and customer lock-in via value-added services.
Growth Markets (Egypt, Jordan, Iraq): Competition here is focused primarily on subsidized acquisition and rapid network establishment. Platforms like Talabat have utilized heavy discounts to gain initial penetration in markets like Iraq.12 While unit economics are initially poor, the successful narrowing of losses by players like Jahez in their Non-KSA platforms (84.7% YoY improvement) indicates a rapid move toward disciplined spending once market footholds are established.10 The primary challenge is maximizing restaurant density and building robust, reliable logistics in complex operational environments.
3.2 Affordability Strategy Comparison
The perception of affordability is a critical battleground, but strategies diverge significantly between sustainable value and pure subsidized price.
Keeta is currently winning the battle for immediate price perception due to its highly visible and aggressive introductory subsidies (50% off first orders).2 This model, while effective for rapid GMV capture, relies on high capital burn and is inherently unsustainable without constant funding.
Talabat achieves affordability through its Talabat Pro subscription, shifting the focus to long-term value and frequency for loyal users.2
Jahez employs the most sophisticated approach, managing affordability through fleet efficiency (5.7% lower delivery cost per order) and offsetting promotional costs with merchant-driven advertisement revenue.4 This model stabilizes the financial impact of discounting.
Noon Food utilizes ecosystem cross-subsidization, where the cost of food delivery discounts is justified by the overall LTV across the broader Noon e-commerce platform.
Talabat's emphasis must be on demonstrating that Pro provides superior, reliable value that outlasts the temporary, subsidized price shock created by new market entrants like Keeta.
3.3 Comparative Metrics Table
The following table provides a strategic comparison across key competitors, focusing on estimated market positioning in 2025.
Competitive Landscape and Estimated Market Share (2025 Projections)
Part IV: Market Trends and Strategic Opportunities
4.1 Emerging Trends in MENA Delivery (2025–2026)
The MENA delivery landscape is rapidly evolving beyond core logistics, driven by shifts in consumer behavior and technology adoption.
4.1.1 Trend: The Rise of Subscription Models and Lock-In
Subscription services are becoming critical strategic battlegrounds. Talabat Pro and Careem Plus have demonstrated the success of converting coupon-focused users into reliable, high-frequency subscribers.2 The prevalence of these models significantly raises the barrier to entry for newcomers, as challengers must spend exponentially more to draw users away from an established, value-driven lock-in structure. This confirms that long-term loyalty is being bought through recurring benefits, not transient discounts.
4.1.2 Trend: Ultra-Fresh, Health, and Meal Kit Demand
Consumer preferences are shifting towards health and convenience, highlighted by the high regional adoption of meal kit services (28% of MENA consumers, compared to 15% globally).15 In KSA, there is pronounced interest in fresh produce and local, health-conscious options.16 This trend necessitates capital investment in cold chain logistics and the sourcing of ultra-fresh produce within the Q-Commerce vertical. Platforms that can credibly deliver high-quality perishables gain a competitive edge over those focused solely on ambient goods or prepared meals.
4.1.3 Trend: Integration of Retail Media and Ad Monetization
The massive growth of Jahez's advertising revenue (60.8% YoY) 4 establishes aggregators as viable Retail Media Platforms (RMPs). This trend transforms the economic relationship with merchants. Restaurants view the delivery app not just as a distribution channel subject to high commissions, but as a critical marketing and visibility tool. Platforms must develop engaging in-app ad products (such as short-form video reels) to solidify these relationships and create a diverse, high-margin revenue stream, mitigating reliance on variable commissions.
4.1.4 Trend: AI/ML for Personalization and Predictive Logistics
Optimization through technology, particularly AI-driven route optimization, is essential for maintaining the high-speed requirements of Q-Commerce and enhancing customer retention.1 Meituan's advanced institutional muscle in logistics technology, leveraged by Keeta 2, standardizes the market requirement for sophistication. The strategic differentiation will stem from which platform can deploy AI not only for faster logistics but also for culturally nuanced personalization and prediction, offering recommendations that deeply resonate with regional consumer tastes and dietary habits.
4.2 The FIFA World Cup 2026 Opportunity
Although the FIFA World Cup 2026 is hosted in North America 17, it represents a major media and consumption event in MENA, particularly in markets with high engagement or qualifying teams, such as Egypt and Qatar. The tournament will generate predictable, concentrated spikes in demand for large, communal meal orders and grocery/snack delivery during match times.
The opportunity for Talabat is to align its new "realness and authenticity" positioning with the cultural significance of shared viewing. Competitors like Keeta are likely to use the event for generic, high-volume discount blasts, focusing purely on transaction numbers. Talabat, conversely, can launch culturally specific campaigns centered on the communal viewing experience (e.g., family gatherings, the Majlis), integrating food delivery into the social fabric of the event. This approach transforms a transactional event into an emotional brand touchpoint. Logistically, this requires robust planning to manage the sharp demand spikes, especially for shared items, ensuring service reliability under pressure.
4.3 Exploiting Competitive Weaknesses: White Space for Talabat's New Positioning
Talabat's commitment to "realness and authenticity" offers a powerful narrative tool to exploit the structural and brand weaknesses of its key competitors.
Exploiting Keeta's Transactional Nature: Keeta's heavy reliance on unsustainable initial subsidies 2 leaves it vulnerable to a narrative critique. Talabat can position Keeta's offer as "fake value," transient and transactional, contrasting it directly with the genuine, consistent, and long-term value delivered through Talabat Pro. Media messaging can emphasize that trust and "real relationships" with customers are built on consistent service, not temporary handouts.
Exploiting Jahez's KSA-Centricity: Outside of KSA, Jahez’s brand equity is weaker, and its expansion remains costly.10 In core Talabat markets (UAE, Kuwait, Egypt), Talabat can reinforce its established regional dominance and deep understanding of diverse MENA consumer needs, positioning Jahez as a capable but geographically limited specialist.
Exploiting Careem’s Functional Focus: Careem's super-app messaging, while ensuring reliability and utility, often lacks emotional depth.2 Talabat can occupy the "emotional white space" by connecting with the spontaneity, joy, and cultural moments surrounding food, portraying delivery as an enhancement of life's authentic moments, rather than just a guaranteed utility.
Exploiting Local Ethical Vulnerabilities (e.g., Iraq): Operational vulnerabilities, such as the potential liability and worker rights issues hinted at in local specialist contracts (like Toters) 13, offer a high-impact differentiation opportunity. Talabat can launch high-profile Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) campaigns focused on rider welfare and safety ("hero meals," road safety 2), positioning itself as the ethically sound, responsible, and "authentic" local employer, contrasting sharply with less transparent competitors.
Part V: Strategic Implications & Opportunities for Talabat
5.1 Recommendations for Media Strategy Pitch (The "Realness" Offensive)
Talabat’s media strategy must move beyond price signaling and aggressively leverage its new authentic positioning to create non-price differentiation against the Keeta threat.
Localized Emotional Resonance: Media spend, particularly in high-reach channels like Out-of-Home (OOH) and television, should be reallocated to focus on culturally specific, high-production content that deeply reflects authentic regional life. Campaigns must illustrate the role of Talabat Pro in simplifying the "real" chaos and joys of daily life—a continuation of the successful #GetTarektogopro narrative.6 The strategy is to position Talabat as a cultural fixture, not merely a utility.
Integrated Retail Media Campaigning: Digital media channels must evolve from simple performance marketing tools to sophisticated drivers of merchant advertising revenue. By developing and promoting interactive ad products like short-form video reels within the app (similar to Jahez's "Fawase!") 4, Talabat transforms its marketing expenditure into a co-investment with its merchant partners, thereby increasing the Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) and deepening platform stickiness.
Ethical Transparency as Differentiation: Use Public Relations (PR) and owned media platforms to proactively showcase commitments to rider welfare, ethical contracts, and local economic contribution. Highlighting responsible operational practices reinforces "authenticity" as a measure of corporate character, providing a stark contrast to competitors whose labor practices may be less transparent or potentially problematic.13
5.2 Financial and Operational Counter-Strategies
The competitive environment demands a dual focus on operational efficiency and financial sophistication to sustain market leadership.
Financial Counter to Keeta: The primary counter-strategy to Keeta’s capital-burning subsidies must be defensive and focused on efficient conversion. Talabat must avoid entering a margin-eroding price war. Instead, it should maximize the rapid conversion of high-frequency, high-value users to the Talabat Pro subscription, utilizing promotional resources primarily for targeted first-time users or those exhibiting high churn risk.
Operational Match for Jahez: Immediate allocation of capital and engineering resources toward accelerating the development of the in-app Retail Media Platform is critical. Jahez’s achievement of 60.8% YoY ad revenue growth provides irrefutable evidence that this is the path to sustainable platform profitability and diversified revenue.4
Q-Commerce Expansion: Strategic investment in specialized cold-chain logistics is required to capitalize on the demonstrable demand for ultra-fresh produce and meal kits (28% MENA usage).15 This investment will defend Talabat’s current leadership in Q-Commerce and provide a crucial quality differentiator against functionally focused competitors.
5.3 Long-Term Brand Equity Roadmap
The long-term goal is to secure Talabat’s position as the indispensable digital and cultural ecosystem for convenience across the MENA region. The brand must strategically shift the consumer perception of "convenience" from solely "speed" (where Keeta is aggressively competing) to "life simplification" and seamless integration, which is the core value proposition of the Talabat Pro subscription.6 Continued efforts to embed the brand through partnerships, financial products, and wallets, while simultaneously ensuring high ethical standards for riders and merchants, will reinforce the "authentic" cultural narrative and maintain the long-term competitive moat. Success will be measured not just by overall GMV, but by the steady growth of Talabat Pro adoption and merchant satisfaction with the retail media platform, key indicators of enduring equity insulated from short-term market subsidies.
